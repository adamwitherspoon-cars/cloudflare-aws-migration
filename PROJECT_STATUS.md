- **Scale**: 2+ billion events, 10-100x performance improvement target

## 📊 **Jira Tickets Overview**

**Total Story Points**: 95 points
**Estimated Timeline**: 3 sprints (6-8 weeks)
**Budget Target**: $2000-5000/month operational cost

### **Epic**: CloudFlare Data Processing Migration to AWS (21 points)

### **Stories**:
1. **Setup Cross-Account IAM Roles** (5 points) - Security foundation
2. **Create S3 Bucket for Processed Data** (3 points) - Storage infrastructure  
3. **Launch EC2 Processing Instance** (8 points) - Compute infrastructure
4. **Migrate Processing Code to AWS** (13 points) - Code migration & optimization
5. **Create Processing Automation Scripts** (8 points) - Operational automation
6. **Setup CloudWatch Monitoring** (5 points) - Observability
7. **Implement Data Validation Pipeline** (8 points) - Quality assurance
8. **Create Cost Monitoring and Alerts** (3 points) - Cost management
9. **Perform Initial Data Migration Test** (8 points) - Testing & validation

11. **Setup Automated Daily Processing** (13 points) - Production operations
12. **Create Documentation and Handover** (5 points) - Knowledge transfer

## 🚀 **Next Steps When Resuming**

### **Immediate Actions**
1. **Import Jira Tickets**: Use the 3 detailed CSV files to create tickets in Jira
2. **Team Assignment**: Assign tickets to infrastructure, development, and QA teams
3. **Sprint Planning**: Organize into 3 sprints based on dependencies

### **Critical Path**
1. IAM Roles → S3 Bucket → EC2 Instance (Infrastructure foundation)
2. Code Migration → Automation Scripts (Development work)
3. Testing → Full Migration → Daily Processing (Implementation)

### **Key Dependencies**
- **Week 1-2**: Infrastructure setup (Stories 1-3)
- **Week 3-4**: Development and automation (Stories 4-6) 
- **Week 5-6**: Testing and migration (Stories 7-10)
- **Week 7-8**: Production setup and handover (Stories 11-12)

## 💡 **Important Notes**

### **Technology Stack Confirmed**
- **Package Manager**: UV (not pip)
- **Processing**: Polars + Python 3.11+
- **Infrastructure**: AWS EC2 r6i.4xlarge, S3, CloudWatch
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch + SNS alerting

### **Account Access**
- **Source**: `di-security` profile for DI Security account
- **Target**: `cars-platform-security` profile with admin access
- **Cross-account**: IAM roles for secure data access

### **Performance Targets**
- **Processing Speed**: >15,000 records/second
- **Daily Processing**: Complete within 2 hours
- **Success Rate**: >95% processing success
- **Cost Target**: $2000-5000/month operational
